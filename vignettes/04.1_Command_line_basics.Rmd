# Some basics about computers

## Background

>- run programs
>- store data
>- communicate with each other
>- interact with us

## Interacting with a computer

There are a few different ways we interact with a computer:  

>- Mouse
>- Keyboard
>- Touchscreen

You can do this either: 

>- within a **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface (GUI) or
>- the command line

## The Command Line

<img src="assets/images/commandline.jpeg" height="350px" width="900px" />

## Shell

When you open your shell first, you will see what is called a _prompt_:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ 
```

## Try our first command

Type the following into the command line: 
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ ls
```

this stands for **list** and will print the content of the folder you currently are in:

```{bash echo=FALSE}
ls
```

## How hard is it to use?

>- A **GUI** provides you with options from which you can choose, whereas the command line is more like a language, where the choices are combinations of commands.  

>- As those commands are not presented to you by default on the screen, again, just like a language, you will need to learn some of the basics to "communicte" with the computer.
